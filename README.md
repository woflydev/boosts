# About this Project

This file is automatically generated. If you're interested in adding your own boosts,`git clone` this repo and run `pnpm start`. Follow the instructions and you should be fine. 

Should I have spent a few hours of my life polishing this CLI and streamlining the entire publishing experience? Probably not. Look it's 12am when I'm writing this and I'm so tired. Why spend 5 minutes doing something when you can spend 5 hours automating it.

So now be treated to some pretty website pictures so I don't feel like all my work has gone to waste.
